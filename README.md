# CI/CD Github Actions

* Creating an automated CI/CD process puts the goal of DevOps into practice. The continuous integration practice of validation frequently encourages the use of small batches that can move quickly through the process. 
* An automated build and test system allows us to check every change and provide feedback much faster than a manual process.
* To automate the process of releasing application builds to development, test, and production environments. In this way. 
* For example if the team can devote time to what really adds value: creating brilliant products.
* With GitHub Actions, we can design our entire workflow in an automated way. We can specify when, how and which tasks to launch. 
* For example, we can decide to launch our test suite, code review tools or even deploy our application, all from GitHub.
